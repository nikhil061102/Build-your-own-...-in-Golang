This is my implementation in Go of the
["Build Your Own Redis" Challenge](https://codecrafters.io/challenges/redis).

In this challenge, I've built a simple [Redis](https://redis.io/) clone that's capable of handling
basic commands like `PING`, `SET` and `GET`, as well as some advanced extensions like [basic replication](https://redis.io/docs/management/replication/),
[streams](https://redis.io/docs/data-types/streams/) and loading [RDB persisted files](https://redis.io/docs/management/persistence/).
